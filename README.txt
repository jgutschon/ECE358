# ECE358 Computer Networks, Group 95, Lab 1

This lab was written by Jonathan Gutschon and Daniel Robson

This is our submission for the ECE358 Computer Networks lab. It utilizes the logic of an M/M/1 and M/M/1/K queue.

## Running the script

To run all questions, simply run:

```python
python3 ./main.py
```

To run an individual question such as question 1, run:

```python
python3 ./main.py -q 1
```

To run multiple questions, run:

```python
python3 ./main.py -q 3 4 6
```

To change the simulation time (defaulted to 1000 sec):

```python
python3 ./main.py -t 2000
```
